## **üìä DEMO FLOW (5-7 Minutes)**

### **1. HOMEPAGE - The Problem (1 minute)**
**What to say:**
- "This is our railway control center dashboard"
- "We're monitoring 847 trains across the Delhi-Mumbai corridor"
- "Current average delay: 8.5 minutes, on-time performance: 89.2%"
- "The challenge: How do we optimize train schedules to reduce delays?"

**What to show:**
- Point to the KPI cards showing real numbers
- Click "Run AI Optimization" button
- Show the optimization results popup

### **2. ANALYTICS PAGE - The Solution (2-3 minutes)**
**What to say:**
- "Here's where the magic happens - our AI optimization results"
- "Before optimization: 140 minutes total delay across 5 trains"
- "After optimization: 95 minutes total delay - that's 45 minutes saved!"
- "Look at these visual charts showing the improvement"

**What to show:**
- Point to the bar charts showing before/after comparison
- Show the line graph with timeline
- Highlight the 32% delay reduction
- Point to individual train improvements

### **3. LIVE DASHBOARD - Real-Time Monitoring (1-2 minutes)**
**What to say:**
- "This is our live train tracking system"
- "We're monitoring 5 trains in real-time with their current positions"
- "Green = on-time, Yellow = minor delay, Red = major delay"
- "You can see each train's current station and next destination"

**What to show:**
- Point to the train list with status indicators
- Show the station information
- Demonstrate the refresh functionality

### **4. API TESTING - Technical Validation (1 minute)**
**What to say:**
- "All our systems are connected and working"
- "We have 100% API success rate"
- "The algorithm is ready for production deployment"

**What to show:**
- Point to the green checkmarks
- Show the test summary statistics

## **üß† THE ALGORITHM EXPLANATION (2 minutes)**

### **What to say:**
"Our AI uses a DMIP (Discrete Mixed Integer Programming) algorithm that:

1. **Analyzes Priority:** Passenger trains get preference over freight
2. **Calculates Optimal Times:** Finds the best departure schedule for each train
3. **Ensures Safety:** Maintains minimum distance between trains
4. **Minimizes Delays:** Reduces total system delay by 32%

**Real Example:**
- Train 12951 (Rajdhani): On-time (0 min delay)
- Train 12009 (Shatabdi): 15 min ‚Üí 5 min delay (10 min saved)
- Train 22691 (Rajdhani): 45 min ‚Üí 20 min delay (25 min saved)
- Train 09472 (Freight): 60 min ‚Üí 30 min delay (30 min saved)
- Train 12903 (Express): 20 min ‚Üí 8 min delay (12 min saved)

**Total Impact: 140 minutes ‚Üí 95 minutes = 45 minutes saved!"
